        <p>When Copenhagen was awarded the title of European Green Capital in 2014, the jury singled out the city’s urban planning and design. The city is also something of a transport pioneer, aiming to become the world’s most cycling-friendly city; a project that seemingly has total buy-in from Copenhagen folk.</p>
        <p><strong>Things to do in Copenhagen: </strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Copenhagen Canal Tour</strong></li>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Canal_Tours_in_Nyhavn_08.jpg"alt="Canal Tour"width="350">

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Nimb_-_Tivoli_Gardens.jpg"alt="Tivoli Gardens"width="350">
        <p>Tivoli Gardens also offers many more relaxed rides for the little ones and for those who don’t want to feel their stomach turn. Watch fairytale scenes as you never have before in the Flying Trunk or climb on the back of an elephant at The Classic Carousel.<br> For a unique view of the city, without the fear of Golden Tower’s speed, take a ride on the Ferris Wheel. Young chauffeurs will love a ride with Vintage Cars — these really have the 1920s look.</p>
